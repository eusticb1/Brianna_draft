**STA-145-Final-Project**

My replication package for my 145 final project. I gathered data on the members of the House of Representatives and anayzed their age, and their leadership positon. I sought to figure out if there was a relationship between member's of the House's age, and wethere they hold a leadership position or not.

**Data**

The data that was used for this project was the ages of the members o the house, as well as their leadership role, and I got this information from the US.House's main website. I wrote down their ages, then calculated the mean, and SD, and compared that to the leadership positions.

**Operationalization**

For this study, two primary variables were selected: age and leadership role of members of the U.S. House of Representatives. Age is determined as the number of years a House member has lived at the time of data collection. This variable is operationalized as a continuous variable, measured in years. Data on age were collected from official congressional biographical records, taken from this website: https://fiscalnote.com/blog/how-old-118th-congress.  Age was chosen for this study due to previous research that suggests that experience may influence the likelihood of holding a leadership position, and the strong correlation between age and experience. The ages of House members ranged from 28 to 88 years, with a mean of approximately 57 years, which indicates a fairly broad distribution. 

The second variable selected was leadership role, which refers to the formal leadership positions held by members within the House of Representatives. This variable is operationalized as an ordinal categorical variable, coded numerically, showing the increasing levels of leadership responsibility: 0 = No leadership role; 1 = Speaker or Minority/Majority Leader; 2 = Committee Chair; 3 = Whip; 4 = Other leadership roles (as applicable). These codes were derived from official congressional records on leadership listings. An ordinal scale was used as leadership positions in the house do have a form of hierarchy based on how much influence/power that position holds. Looking at descriptive stats, there is an unequal distribution of power, with few members in high leadership positions. However, this is normal as there are only few positions to be had.
